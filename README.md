#### <span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Context</span>
<p style="font-size: 15px; color: #333333;">
    The following EDA is based on 12 months worth of sales data from an electronics store. I have attempted to answer a set of key business questions which provide a comprehensive view of the storeâ€™s sales performance over the 12-month period, offering valuable insights into consumer purchasing behavior, product demand, and trends.

<ol style="font-size: 15px; color: #333333;">
    <li>Which month had the highest sales, and how much revenue was generated?</li>
    <li>What city recorded the highest sales?</li>
    <li>When is the best time to display ads for maximum sales impact?</li>
    <li>What products are frequently purchased together?</li>
    <li>Which product had the highest sales, and what factors might explain its success?</li>
</ol>
